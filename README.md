## Project's [Overview](https://whimsical.com/new-nightmare-9NDnxgdLHz5qcVsMzCGwjy)

-   The web app described provides various services such as social media management, real-time chat, and music streaming. It has two main components, the frontend named "Nebula" and the backend named "Nexus". The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the backend handles the processing and management of the services.

The frontend will also handle user authentication and authorization for secure access to the services and provide real-time notifications and updates.

-   The backend, on the other hand, will handle server-side processing, data storage and management using a suitable database, API integrations, real-time communication management, user authentication and authorization, and scalability and performance optimization.
